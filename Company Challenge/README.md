Information regarding the dataset:

* The dataset is for restaurant sales for Friday and Saturday, both lunch and dinner time. There are few instances of 'To-Go' orders like Uber Eats in this dataset.
* typical lunch hour is 11:30AM-2:00PM, and dinner hour is 6:30PM-10:00PM
* some of the data is missing so is represented as 'na' in the data set

We will follow below things to run the challenge successfully:

* The data set is just for Friday and Saturday. The candidate needs to expand and randomize the data for min. of 6 months (Jan. 2019 to June 2019) for all days of the week.
* A typical restaurant has high covers (number of customers) on Friday, Weekend Dinner, followed by Sat/Sun Lunch and then relatively low covers for Monday to Friday Lunch.
* the data expansion/randomization should follow the above pattern for number of customers.

Tasks:
* Run min. of 3 different data science models and determine the best model.
* Predict top 'Menu Item' and 'Item Qty' for lunch and dinner. These predictions will be for future dates (Monday to Sunday, July 1st to July 7th)
